🧵 AI is changing video creation forever. Here's what I've learned using 6 different platforms:

1/ Traditional video editing used to take me 8+ hours per video. Between filming, editing, adding music, creating graphics... it was exhausting.

2/ Then I discovered AI video platforms. Each one had amazing features but switching between tools was still messy.

3/ That's when I found an all-in-one solution that combines:
• Synthesia (AI avatars)
• InVideo (templates)  
• Pictory (content transformation)
• Runway (cinematic quality)
• Veed.io (subtitles)
• Topview.ai (viral optimization)

4/ Now I create professional videos in minutes, not hours. The ROI on my content has increased 300%.

5/ If you're still editing videos the old way, you're missing out on this revolution.

### Thread 2: Personal Story
```
🧵 How I went from 2 videos per month to 50+ using AI (true story)

1/ Six months ago, I was burning out creating content. Each video took forever, looked amateur, and got minimal engagement.

2/ I tried hiring editors but costs were too high. I tried learning advanced editing but had no time.

3/ Then I discovered AI video generation. Started with one platform, then another, then another...

4/ Problem: I was paying for 6 different tools and constantly switching between them. My workflow was still messy.

5/ Found an integrated platform that combined all my favorite AI tools. Game changer.

6/ Results after 3 months:
• 2,500% increase in video output
• 70% lower production costs  
• 10x better engagement rates
• Saved 40+ hours per week

7/ The future of content creation is here. Those who adapt early will have a massive advantage.

🧵 7 AI video hacks that will blow your mind:

1/ Use Synthesia to create multilingual content without learning new languages. One script → videos in 140+ languages.

2/ Transform old blog posts into engaging videos with Pictory. Your evergreen content gets new life.

3/ Create viral-style testimonials with Topview.ai even if you don't have customer footage.

4/ Use InVideo templates to maintain brand consistency across all platforms while saving design time.

5/ Add professional subtitles to any video in minutes with Veed.io. Accessibility = more reach.

6/ Generate B-roll footage with Runway when you don't have the budget for a film crew.
